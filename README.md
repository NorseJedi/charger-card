> EV Charger card for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] Lovelace UI


By default, Home Assistant does not provide any card for controlling chargers for electrical vehicles (EVs). This card displays the state and allows to control your charger - and it is now made fully customizable so you could also use it for ¬´anything¬ª else as well, for instance your electric car.

# Installation

### Installation with HACS

Installation with [HACS][hacs] (Home Assistant Community Store) is highly reccomended but requires that you have this installed on your Home Assistant. The charger-card is available just by searching for `Charger Card` under the Frontend-section of HACS.

### Manual
Alternatively you could install the card manually by following the steps below:

1. Download `charger-card.js` file from the [latest-release].
2. Put `charger-card.js` file into your `config/www` folder.
3. Add reference to `charger-card.js` in Lovelace. There are two ways to do that:
   1. **Using UI:** _Configuration_ ‚Üí _Lovelace Dashboards_ ‚Üí _Resources_ ‚Üí Click Plus button ‚Üí Set _Url_ as `/local/charger-card.js` ‚Üí Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
   2. **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.
      ```yaml
      resources:
        - url: /local/charger-card.js
          type: module
      ```
4. Add `custom:charger-card` to Lovelace UI as any other card (using either UI-editor or YAML-configuration).

# Configuring and using the card

After installation, the card can be configured either using Lovelace UI editor or YAML-code.

1. In Lovelace UI, click the 3 dots in top right corner and select _Edit Dashboard_
2. Click Plus button to add a new card.
3. Find _Custom: Charger Card_ in the list.
4. Choose `brand` from the list which fits your need or select other.
5. Choose `entity` and select the main status sensor of your charger.
6. Now you should see the preview of the card!
7. Do your customizations in UI editor or manually in the YAML code editor.

Even if you prefer to configure an advanced and custom YAML-code, it is reccomended to use the UI at first since it will generate a template for the YAML-code that you can continue modifying.

Here is a list of the options. See [_advanced configuration_](#advanced-configuration) further down for more details.

## Features

- Fully customizable for your needs, the card works for different chargers and other entities if you read the [_advanced configuration_](#advanced-configuration) section and customize it to your needs. For chargers that are supported by default templates, the setup is very easy: select brand and main entity and you should be done.
- Animations: If choosing the default images of Easee chargers in any color, you can also choose to show leds which will behave according to charger status. This is identical to how the charger looks physically and similar to the Easee app and web site. Two leds for standby, all leds when connected, flashing while charging and so on. If SmartCharging is enabled, leds will be blue.
- Collapsible menu buttons: Click on one of the menu buttons (if you have enabled them) to get more info, config or limit settings. Can also be customized.
- Possibility to set current limits from UI. Current limits can also be customized.
- Customizable data table (stats) items that can depend on charger status and show relevant information.
- Customizable toolbar with buttons to call services or do something which. The toolbar can depend on charger status and show relevant actions.

## Supported languages

This card supports translations. Please, help to add more translations and improve existing ones. Here's a list of supported languages:

- English
- Norsk bokm√•l (Norwegian)
- Svenska (by [jockesoft](https://github.com/jockesoft))
- German (by [DeerMaximum](https://github.com/DeerMaximum))
- Danish (by [dykandDK](https://github.com/dykandDK))
- Catalan (by [gerardag](https://github.com/gerardag))
- Dutch (by [posixx](https://github.com/posixx))
- [_Your language?_][add-translation]

## Supported models

This card was originally made to support charging robots from [Easee](https://easee-international.com/), but has been further developed to be fully configurable and customizable and can be used with any kind of charger. It can even be used for other things than EV-chargers, for instance your electric car or something completely different. Some `brand`s are added with built-in support to make the configuration really easy:

- Easee
- Zaptec Go
- [_Your charger?_](https://github.com/tmjo/charger-card/wiki/How-to-add-template-for-new-brand)

See [Wiki on how to add a brand](https://github.com/tmjo/charger-card/wiki/How-to-add-template-for-new-brand).

### Note for Zaptec Go
Since the Eco Mode (Smartmode) setting for Zaptec is only available as a bitwise feature-sensor on the Installation entity, it is recommended to create a template sensor for this in your configuration.yaml.
The sensor can be created like this:
```
template:
  - binary_sensor
    - name: Elbillader EcoMode
      state: >-
        {% set ecomode = state_attr('binary_sensor.INSTALLATION-NAME_installation', 'enabled_features')|bitwise_and(8) %}
        {% if ecomode %}
          on
        {% else %}
          off
        {% endif %}
      icon: >-
        {% set ecomode = state_attr('binary_sensor.INSTALLATION-NAME_installation', 'enabled_features')|bitwise_and(8) %}
        {% if ecomode %}
          mdi:cloud
        {% else %}
          mdi:cloud-off
        {% endif %}
```

# Advanced configuration

If your brand is on the list of supported models, you should be able to get away just by selecting the `brand` and `entity` main sensor from the UI editor of Home Assistant. However, if you want to fully customize it or use it for something else than supported by default `brand`s, you must do this yourself with YAML-code. It may seem overwhelming at first, so a trick can be applying a built-in `brand` as a template and start modifying the YAML code from there - this will give you the basic structure. Also see the examples further down.


| Name                               |   Type    | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `debug`                             | `boolean`  | `false` | Apply `true` to enable some debugging features which will appear in Developer Tools of your browser (Ctrl+Shift+I in Chrome). Useful if something doesn't work.
| `localize`                             | `boolean`  | `true` | Apply `false` to disable all translations, for instance if you want to fully customize texts and the translation feature for some reason messes up you stuff. Normally not necessary.
| `details`                       | `details` |        | Details for customization if the default brand template doesn't do what you want it to. See [`details`-items](#details-items)  |

| attribute             | You can specify an attribute of the entity to use instead of entity state as value. |
| unit                  | Card will use the entity `unit_of_measurement` as default, but you can override it here by entering the unit you want.|
| unit_show             | Define if the unit should be shown next to the value or not.|
| unit_showontext       | Define if the value and unit should be shown next to the tooltip text|
| text                  | Card will use the entity `friendly_name` as default, but you can override it here by entering the text you want. Used as tooltip text for icons and as information on stats.|
| service               | You can specify a service that you wish to link to the entity, check available services in HA Developer Tools. Use full format like `domain.servicename`|
| service_data          | Specify the service data corresponding to the service you want to call. If it is not a static call, but for instance a call with a value selected from a dropdown menu, enter `#SERVICEVAL#` as a special token which will be replaced by the card when called. See advanced configuration for example. |
| icon                  | Card will use the entity icon as default, and will try to detect device class icons as well. If you want to override it, do it here by specifying a valid icon.|
| round                 | If you would like to round down the number, specify an integer to define the number of digits.|
| type                  | Choose between `info`, `service` and `dropdown`. Info-items will appear as icons with tooltip, clicking them opens the more-info popup for the entity. Service-items will do the same, but call a service when clicked (if it is provided). Dropdown-items will show a dropdown list to select from a list and call a specified service with this number as service data. |
| dropdownitems         | List of items used for dropdown values if the type is `dropdown`. Defaults to `currentlimits` if not specified. |
| calc_function         | Choose between `min`, `max`, `mean`, `sum` to define a mathematical function to be performed on a specified list of entities or attributes. The result will be used on the sensor provided you specify `calculated` instead of a real `entity_id`. Then add a list of entities to be calculated in `calc_entities`.|
| calc_entities         | A list of entites or entity attributes that are used for the mathematical function. Specify a list of `entity_id`s and add `attribute`s if you prefer to use that.|
| conditional_entity    | Specify a boolean entity (returning on/off or true/false) to define if the entity should be shown based on state condition.|
| conditional_attribute | Specify a boolean entity and its attribute (returning on/off or true/false) to define if the entity should be shown based on state attribute condition.|
| conditional_invert    | Invert the conditional rule, so that true/on means hide and false/off means show |


## Advanced example (Easee charger)
In service data, you can choose if you want to use device_id or entity_id depending on the service interface you are using. The Easee-example below was changed from entity_id to device_id due to changes in the integration.

Items in capital letters are meant to be replaced with your actual names, but do not change the ones surrounded by # such as #SERVICEVAL# as these are used in the code. When you do the configuration from UI, the card config tries to fill your data automatically.
